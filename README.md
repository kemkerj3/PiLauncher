# PiLauncher
Raspberry Pi Rocket Launch Controller

PiLauncher is a set of Python scripts to control one or more 4 Relay Modules from a Raspberry Pi in order to launch
model or High-Power rockets.  Plans are to provide functionality to launch individual rockets, to launch two or more
rockets in a "drag race" and to provide continuity checks from both the pad and the launch control table.
