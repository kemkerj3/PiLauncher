# PiLauncher
Raspberry Pi Rocket Launch Controller

PiLauncher is a set of Python scripts and html to control one or more 4 Relay Modules from a Raspberry Pi in order to launch
model or High-Power rockets.  Plans are to provide functionality to launch individual rockets, to launch two or more
rockets in a "drag race" and to provide continuity checks from both the pad and the launch control table.

It also includes hardware specifications for the launcher.  Hardware is licensed under the TAPR Open Hardware license.  See OHL_License.txt for full license conditions.
